Hello There,

As I may have said, I am Jerad. I love learning, discovery and sharing what I can regurgitate.  

These are some tools that should help along the way.  

Be inclined to check them out yourself and see what you find.  

Also know that I keep this as an updated list of what I am currently looking out for. So if you would like, through one of these in your basket and send it over to me:  
2304 Azure ln  
Vista CA, 92081  
USA  

Thank you for the time you have invested in what I have had to say here. I hope some of the ideas transduced here stick and help with your journey.  

Understand, I love you.

If you have something special you think I should look into, it would be a priviledge here from you on the matter. Be careful with the apples, a cup of seeds are poisenous - or so I've heard.

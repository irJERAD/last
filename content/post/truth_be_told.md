Conflict.  

At the center of two bodies there is always conflict.  

Conflict exists until they reach a singular state of unity.  

You see, when we gather, there will always be a difference.  

Something between you and I, between her and him, between us and the rest of them.  

And that is ok.  

Our individuality breads culture.  
It reveals the beautfy in diversity.  

What makes us different, makes us unique.  

And we can love that about one and other.  

But when your unqinueness encrouches upon my individuality.  

Her special is smearing my identity.  

We can feel a claustrophobic threat to who we are and what we do, each of us.  

Have no fear. Do not act from envy or lust or greed.  

When you see another as someone or with something, be happy for them, feel sorrow for them, or free yourself to a stoic nature.  

Today was a gift. Go home to die. And see tomorrow if you wake.

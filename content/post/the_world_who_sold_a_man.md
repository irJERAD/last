I was once a boy. A decent boy at that.  

I loved my mom. I was proud of my father.  
I had a loving sister and an amazing family.  

As a child I felt close to E.T. As though they were folding laundry next to me and a thrust my rear end top their body and my face to a red short wearing Mickey Mouse.  

My brother had the missfortune of being born with a heart defect. Over 30 years later, his condition grew to both a heart and a lung.  
In his nearly 3 months of pain he had a moment of joy and laughter. My mother caught it on disposable camera. My brother and his only laugh and me buttoning up his onezie.  

When I was about 4 or 5 my parents and I went to florida for a cruise. The Big Red boat. It was a Disney cruise and we sailed across the caribean. While in the warm caribean waters I almost stepped on a jellyfish.  

As a student in grammar school I was not very too great. I would space out and even got into a few fights after my parents divorced.  

In second grade I pointed out my favorite planet, Saturn. I explained that the number of moons it had was growing.
